### The proactive agent for real workflows — not just browser tasks.

A background coworker that runs on your VPS, watches for events, gets work done, and syncs the results back to your local workspace.

Most AI agents wait for a prompt. Nono starts when something happens.

It can monitor your email, synced folders, and the apps you connect to it. When a partner sends a contract at 2 AM, Nono downloads the attachment, retrieves last year's agreement from your synced workspace, compares them clause by clause, flags key changes, and drafts a reply.

By the time you open your laptop in the morning, a notification card is waiting on your desktop: *"Contract received. 3 key changes flagged. Draft reply ready for review."* The diff report is already in your local folder. No downloads, no separate dashboard — **the file is already where you work.** Click "Send", and the email goes out.

Away from your computer? Nono can notify you via Telegram or Feishu too.

**This isn't an assistant waiting for instructions. It's a coworker that's already at work.**

## What Makes This Different

AI agents can already do a lot. But most still fall into the same trade-offs:

| Approach | The Problem |
|:---|:---|
| **Cloud agents** | Work 24/7, but files stay in their cloud. You still have to download and move everything back into your workflow. |
| **Desktop agents** | Can work with local files, but usually require your computer to stay online — and often need broader access to your local environment. |
| **Automation tools** | Great at connecting apps, but limited to predefined if-this-then-that workflows. |

**Nono CoWork takes a different approach: it keeps the agent online on your VPS while delivering outputs back into the folders you already use.**

- 🧠 **Proactive** — Monitors email, file changes, and connected apps. Acts when something important happens — no prompt required.
- ☁️ **Always on** — Runs continuously on your VPS, so work can keep moving even when your laptop is closed.
- 📁 **Local-first delivery** — Results sync directly into your local folders, so outputs show up where you already work.
- 🔒 **Isolated by architecture** — Runs on your VPS and cannot directly control your local device. It only sees the folders you explicitly sync.
- ✋ **Human-in-the-loop** — Drafts the email, but waits for your approval before sending. Critical actions wait for your review.

## It Moves Your Workflow Forward

| When this happens | Nono gets this done first | You only need to... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 📧 A partner sends a new contract | Download the attachment → retrieve related versions → compare key clauses → draft a reply | Review the diff and decide whether to send |
| 📬 A client goes silent for 3 days | Detect the stalled thread → quote the original conversation → draft a polite follow-up email | Click confirm and let it send |
| 📊 You drop a spreadsheet into your local work folder | Detect the new file → run analysis → generate charts and conclusions → save a finished report | Open the report |
| 🗂️ Your inbox fills up with PDFs, screenshots, and loose documents | Identify each file type → rename and categorize it → move it into the right folder | Check the results when you want |

> It doesn't wait for one-off prompts. When something happens, it pushes the work forward until only the final decision needs your input.

## Quick Start

**Requirements:** A Linux VPS · Python ≥ 3.12 · [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KilYep/nono-cowork.git
cd nono-cowork
uv sync
cp .env.example .env   # Edit with your LLM API key
```

```bash
# Start with selected channels (recommended)
CHANNELS=desktop,feishu,telegram uv run python src/main.py

# Or run a single channel for testing
uv run agent            # Terminal REPL (simplest)
uv run feishu-bot       # Feishu only
uv run telegram-bot     # Telegram only
uv run desktop-agent    # Desktop API only
```

For long-running deployment, install the included systemd service:

```bash
sudo cp nono-cowork.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable --now nono-cowork
```

> 💡 Works with major LLMs via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) — Qwen, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, GPT, and more. Change one setting in `.env`.

> **Minimal test (no Syncthing or Composio required):** Set an API key in `.env` and run `uv run agent`. You'll have a working agent in the terminal in under 2 minutes. Add Syncthing for file sync and Composio for app triggers when you're ready.

## Core Capabilities

### 🔥 Proactive Automation (Routines)
- **Cron schedules** — "Every morning at 8 AM, compile a news briefing"
- **Event triggers** — "When a new email arrives from @partner.com, process it"
- **File watchers** — "When a file appears in /inbox/, analyze it"
- **Human-in-the-loop** — Structured notification cards with approve/reject actions

### 🛠️ Agent Toolkit
- **File operations** — Read, write, and edit common file types, including PDF, Excel, and Word
- **Shell execution** — Run shell commands on the VPS
- **Web access** — Search the web and extract content from web pages
- **1,000+ app integrations** — Gmail, GitHub, Slack, Notion, and more via [Composio](https://composio.dev)
- **Syncthing control** — Check sync status, pause/resume, and restore file versions
- **Sub-agent delegation** — Spin up isolated agent sessions for complex tasks
- **Persistent context** — Remembers your preferences and context across sessions

### 📡 Multi-Channel
- **Desktop App** — Electron-based UI with real-time streaming, a notification center, routine management, built-in settings, and guided Syncthing pairing
- **Telegram** — Full-featured bot with inline actions
- **Feishu (Lark)** — Native WebSocket integration
- **Terminal** — Direct CLI access

### 🔒 Security by Architecture
- Agent runs on an **isolated VPS** — it cannot directly control your local device
- Files sync via **Syncthing's encrypted peer-to-peer protocol** — no central storage service
- **Selective sync** — the agent only sees folders you explicitly share
- **Access control** — restrict to specific Telegram/Feishu user IDs
- **API token auth** — Desktop API secured with Bearer tokens
